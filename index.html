                    <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
                    <P>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible
                        <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken
                        <abbr title="Casecading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</P>
                    <P>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts
                        of folk like the
                        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consoritium">W3C</abbr> ,
                        <abbr title="">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</P>
                    <P>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to
                        see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become
                        one with the web.</P>

                        amazing CSS really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web
                        today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all

                    <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
                    <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are
                        necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them
                        as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working
                        with CSS. You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting
                        at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use
                        the sample files as a guide. Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you
                        have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file
                        to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated
                        assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>

                    <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
                    <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
                        elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical
                        CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real
                        requirement we have is that your CSS validates. Luckily, designing this way shows how well various
                        browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent
                        results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days
                        — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform.
                        That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the
                        latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population). We ask that
                        you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to
                        a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past
                        the point of needing another garden-related design. This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration.
                        You retain full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines),
                        but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site
                        so that others may learn from your work.</p>
